Hello! I am a Software Engineer based in New York City and I love to code! I have over 10 years experice with vaious types of programming but my heart lies on the backend. I've always been interested in Big Data and data processing and that's what I've primarily focused on in my career, though I am a full-stack developer and know my way around the front end when needed. I have experience with many languages including Python, Java, and C++. 

I am also and educator! I started teaching Software Engineering during the pandemic and found and I enjoy it and have a knack for it. I fell in love with programming in college and I enjoy introducing new programmers to the same topics that made me fall in love with it. 

Socialization is very important to me. I got in to teaching during the pandemic because it provided a much needed social outlet for me at the time. I am very much the kind of person that prefers to work in-person/hybrid and you will always find me at any after work happy hours!

Outside of programming, my interests include movies (campy ones in particular), musicals, singing, piano, video games (I'm an old-school Mario fan), and trivia.

If you would like to know more or are just looking to connect, feel free to reach out to me on the social links below!
